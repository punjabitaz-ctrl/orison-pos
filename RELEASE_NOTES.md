# Orison POS — Release Notes

Every release is a **tagged commit** on `main` (`vX.Y.Z`), validated before
ship, with docs/assets kept in the same commit. This file highlights the
current release and the run that led here; `CHANGELOG.md` carries the full,
line-by-line detail for every version.

## Latest: v1.9.0 — customer statements

**2026-09-09.** A customer's book can now be handed over as a proper document:
a chronological statement of account with debit/credit lines and a running
balance, printable on the register's 80 mm thermal and exportable to CSV.

**What shipped**

- **Statement of account.** `/api/customers/statement` (admin/manager) walks
  every completed transaction a customer has touched — sales charged net-30/on
  account debit, store-credit refunds and collections credit — oldest first,
  closing exactly on the ledger balance.
- **From Customers → ledger → *Statement***: date / details / debit / credit /
  balance rows, the closing balance, *Print* and *CSV* buttons.
- Every line carries the original reference, the cashier's name, and the note,
  so a disputed balance can be traced back to the till.
- CSV export guards against formula injection (`= + - @` prefixed).

**Validation:** backend-sim **PASS 330 / FAIL 0** · pdf-smoke **PASS 19 / FAIL 0** ·
`node --check` clean.

### Deploying

1. Redeploy `backend/Code.gs` as the Apps Script Web App (no new tabs this
   revision; existing workbook untouched).
2. Cloudflare Pages keeps serving `public/` — the new shell rolls out on next
   load.
3. One hard reload if anything looks stale on an installed terminal.

## The road here (1.8.0 → 1.9.0)

| Version | What shipped |
| --- | --- |
| **v1.9.0** | Customer statements — chronological debit/credit statement of account with a running balance (sales on account debit; store-credit refunds and collections credit), printable and CSV-exportable from the ledger. |
| **v1.8.0** | Price history & tracking — per-product audit of every cost/retail change (create baseline, manual patch, PO weighted-cost receipt with the order number) browsable from the Products screen. |
| **v1.7.1** | Post-review hardening — refunds admin/manager-only, role changes revoke sessions immediately, export stops counting purchase receipts as SALES and nets collections as money-in, service-worker cache un-stuck (v1.7.1 versioned + precaches new screens), docs locked in step. |
| **v1.7.0** | Suppliers & **purchase orders** — vendor records, PO lifecycle (draft → ordered → partial/received → cancelled), receiving that posts stock at weighted-average cost with per-unit serial intake and a ledger trail that never touches drawer math. |
| **v1.6.0** | Reports & analytics — KPIs (gross sales, refunds, payouts, collections, net revenue, GP) plus by-day/category/cashier/tender views, top products & customers, CSV export. |
| **v1.6.0** | Reports & analytics — KPIs (gross sales, refunds, payouts, collections, net revenue, GP) plus by-day/category/cashier/tender views, top products & customers, CSV export. |
| **v1.5.0** | Till shifts — open with a float, close with a denomination count, *declared / expected / over-short* per cashier, `kind`-aware cash math. |
| **v1.4.1** | Receivables grow teeth — record payments against customer accounts, receivables view, 30/60/90+ aging buckets, net-30 tenders. |
| **v1.4.0** | Customers — attach any sale to a customer account; store-credit and on-account tenders from checkout. |
| **v1.3.1** | Profit visibility — gross profit derived from tracked costs on the reports/overview screens. |
| **v1.3.0** | Staff accounts in-app — create users with a one-time PIN from Settings; role management without hand-editing the sheet. |
| **v1.2.7** | Sync-conflict email alerts — coalesced digest to admin/manager when offline conflicts land. |
| **v1.2.6** | Discounts & sales tax — per-line and per-order percentage discounts, taxable flags, store tax rate, all in integer cents. |
| **v1.2.5** | Offline sign-in hardening — the offline credential no longer stores bare PIN hashes; rotated server-side. |
| **v1.2.4** | Per-device revocation — cut off a single lost terminal without rotating the shared token; v4 UUID seed PINs reshaped. |
| **v1.2.3** | Token revocation + lost-device reflex + strict Content-Security-Policy across the static site. |

Releases before v1.2.3 (`v1.0.x`–`v1.2.2`, tags only) predate the changelog:
core register (catalog, cart, split tender, receipts, serial checkout) and the
first security pass (salted PIN hashes, session tokens, login lockout, offline
credentials, conflict registry). `v0.2.1` was the login-path security release.
